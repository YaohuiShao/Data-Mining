done development work on all and they each have their pluses and minor downsides to iPhone development are that you have to have an Mac for and you have to pay to join the developer program if you want to run your programs on an actual phone or he other two platforms let you use Windows or and you have to pay anything just to play never really captured my imagination as a platform and but have the same fun quotient as developing for the The documentation was but I think getting just recently started working with WebOS on the and a lot of The SDK and tools are a little rough you might expect for version but fun working in JavaScript language I previously have much experience to answer your exciting new technologies I the and the Cocoa If you developed on a Mac be an interesting a LOT of functionality there in the and the approach they take is very unlike a lot of other OOP with a concentration on composition and rather than subclassing and is just Java with a different UI I get fully engaged with the so maybe something cool there that I webOS platform is something very closely based on the JavaScript environment loved by web of but there are enough extensions to make it possible to write It seems pretty straightforward to do the usual good the available environments happen to like so I think iPhone wins In addition to the Apple also provides tools for profiling and performance tuning that are quite With Android and likely to be using Eclipse with the appropriate Eclipse and I really get which was probably part of why I get into Android as existing available or are under know about this for any of the really what was provided by the base SDK was enough for the things I I think iPhone has a lot of third parties working on frameworks for various Most any JavaScript library works on so there are a lot of interesting libraries from to to well documented the platform APIs some of the developer tools could use better but the API framework documentation is lots of more up to date now than it was in the some parts are documented better than Being able to look at the Javascript app and framework code helps in cases where the documentation is less neat features of the platform accessible via the APIs is very The iPhone has some weird though they tend to get better with succeeding SDK I think webOS is currently the most limited in some ways the JavaScript API allow for sound or so most games are a more APIs will be available in future other considerations I think of

provider will automatically do the reset for sample just returns the new password to the browser instead of emailing the user but uses the secret question answer that can be configured with the sample gets the password and emails think either approach is The email it step is a bit safer since the user will have to know the and email password to hack an realize these samples are not using MVC but I am sure enough to get you
you want really to my closest thing to what you on a generic is It turns a process into a little server that will accept debugging This is generally used for debugging and profiling and not as interprocess but its a I believe Perl can be run as an XDebug you need explicitly program in some sort of that your Perl program listens to for commands is what XDebug It can be as simple as opening a socket that reads a evals encodes the result as YAML and writes it A but on a socket rather than on a security implications which will be left as an exercise for the You also want listening to the socket to interrupt the program so you will now need something or I have anything more It would make a great CPAN
