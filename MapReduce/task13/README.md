# Task 13

For large data, running reservoir sampling on a single machine would take too long. Imple- ment a MapReduce version of reservoir sampling which uniformly samples only a single line and uses MapReduce to do so. Use your implementation to sample a single line from the file webLarge.txt. Your output should contain only a single line.
