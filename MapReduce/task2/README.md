# Task 2
Using MAPREDUCE write a program that will filter the upper-case version (from task 1) such that only lines that appear exactly once will be in the output. Call this the unique-only version. Your approach should be exact (do not use approximate techniques). The output will be used for some of the following tasks. For example, for the file: bob had a little lamb and a small cat alice had one tiger bob had a little lamb and a small cat mary had some small dogs and a rabbit mary had some small dogs and a rabbit bob had a little lamb and a small catthe output should be: alice had one tigerbecause alice had one tiger is the only line that appeared exactly once in the input.
