# Task 2

Make your own implementation of a Bloom filter. We leave the choice of a hashing function up to you. Write a program that uses your implementation of Bloom filter to approximately de-duplicate the lines in the file webLarge.txt. The output of an approximate de-duplication contains no duplicate lines, but some lines from the input might not appear at all in the output. You should think carefully about the number of hashing functions and the size of the Bloom filter you use. The probability that a line (and its duplicates) from the input does not appear at all in the output should be less than 1% You can assume that your hashing functions produce every value equally likely. When choosing the size of your Bloom filter and number of hashing functions, you should assume the worst case in which all lines are unique. The number of lines should be a command-line parameter to your program.
